## 📌 Project Overview

Air pollution is a major environmental and public health concern worldwide. This project provides a unified platform to:
- Monitor real-time air quality parameters
- Predict AQI values using a trained Machine Learning model
- Visualize pollution trends and geographic distribution
- Provide health recommendations based on AQI levels

The system is designed as a **final year engineering project** and follows industry-standard development practices.
